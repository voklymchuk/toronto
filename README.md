The latest release of census neighborhood-level profiles is available in open data catalog at https://www.toronto.ca/ . In this project census data was used in combination with Foursquare API data to determine how similar or different neighborhoods are. Is Scarborough more like Downtown Toronto or some other neighborhood? Folium choropleth map was used to visualize final neighborhood grouping, neighborhood cluster labels, and some neighborhood feature values.
